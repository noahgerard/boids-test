### Boids Simulation
Simple flocking behavior simulation

## Features
- Craig Reynolds' Boids algorithm (Seperation, Cohesion, Alignment)

## Todo
- More complex behaviors
	- [ ] Avoidance (Obstacle)
	- [ ] Attraction (Food)
	- [ ] Repulsion (Predator)
	- [ ] Attraction (Leader)

- View rule (FOV)

- More complex environment
	- [ ] Obstacles
	- [ ] Walls

- [ ] Different roles (Leader, Follower, Scout etc)
- [ ] Adjustable parameters
- [ ] Optimizations (Quadtree/Spacial Subdivision)
